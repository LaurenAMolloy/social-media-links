## My process

I started by reviewing the design docs and planning which HTML elements I would need to use. I did a quick sketch to paln the containers and buttons. Then I coded the html, before moving onto the css. I used a mobile first approach in the styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to remove custom styles on buttons. I learnt about pseudo states and how to create the hover and active states.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about using vh in projects.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) - This helped me to create the hover state.
